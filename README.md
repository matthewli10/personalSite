# Matthew Li - Personal Website

Personal website built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Features interactive components and sections for my experience, projects, and notes.

## How I Built It

This website uses Next.js 15 with the App Router for dynamic routing and static generation. I styled it with Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistent design. The site includes:

- Dynamic routes for individual experience and note pages
- Animated backgrounds with CSS gradients and keyframes
- Responsive layouts using Tailwind's grid and flexbox utilities
- TypeScript for type safety and better development experience

## Deployment

I deployed this site to Vercel, which automatically builds and deploys from my GitHub repository. Vercel's Next.js integration makes deployment pretty easy.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
